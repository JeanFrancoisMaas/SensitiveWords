Deployment:

SQL Database should be created on the server, or created on a cloud platform (Scripts can be found in the solution folder).
Connection strings updated to use server IP or cloud platform address instead of localhost.

Redis should be installed on the server.

Depending on the infrastructure at use:
Option 1: Deploy Microservice to server.
Option 2: Deploy Microservice to K8s.

**in an ideal scenario this would be automated with pipelines.
